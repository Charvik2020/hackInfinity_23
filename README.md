# Disease Detection and Identification in Cotton Leaves.

We have identified 3 main diseases in cotton leaves:
1) Bacterial Blight
2) Grey Mildew
3) 

We have made use of Machine Learning Algorithms like Multi-SVM(Suppport Vector Machine), K-means Clustering and Nearest Neighbour
Algorithm to detect and identify the diseases.
This project was a part of DAIICT Hackathon, HackInfinity (Team - 23).
